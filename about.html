                <br>
                <p>Liverpool is one of the best supported clubs in the world.[83][84] The club states that its worldwide
                    fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries.
                    Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly.[85] The club takes advantage of this support through
                    its worldwide summer tours,[86] which has included playing in front of 101,000 in Michigan,
                    U.S., and 95,000 in Melbourne, Australia.[87][88] Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as
                    Kopites,
                    a reference to the fans who once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield.</p>

                <h2>Our song</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The song "You'll Never Walk Alone", originally from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and
                    later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry and the Pacemakers, is the club's anthem and has been
                    sung by the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s.[91] It has since gained popularity among fans of
                    other clubs around the world.[92] The song's title adorns the top of the Shankly Gates, which were
                    unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The "You'll Never Walk Alone"
                    portion of the Shankly Gates is also reproduced on the club's crest.</p>
